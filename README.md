# Simple Image Converter
A simple image converting python script with GUI. Originally made to handle HEIC files and other raw files from iphones and DSLRs.

I tried adding support for the more futuristic formats but the implementation is a bit limited. Converting to AVIF is possible, and JXL is also possible only if ffmpeg is in your PATH.
