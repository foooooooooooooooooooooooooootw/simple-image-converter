# Simple Image Converter üñºÔ∏è‚ú®
<p>A simple and intuitive Python image conversion tool with a graphical user interface, designed to do simple manipulation of image files without having to upload them somewhere or open a full-fledged image editor.</p>
<br>
<p>I first made this for personal use because my friends kept sending me HEIC & RAW files and I couldn't open them. I didn't want to upload them to a random website to convert/resize them, and I didn't want to open krita or photoshop every time I got a file so now we're here. Image compression was also an issue for me for websites with file limits and there's no way to make webps easily.</p>
<br>

## Features
- üîÑ Converts all types of files including HEIC and RAW files to other formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG)

- ‚ÜïÔ∏è Resize & Compress images for websites and online usage

- ü§ñ Upscale images with REALESRGAN

- üñ•Ô∏è User-friendly GUI for easy interaction (no command line needed!)

- üìÇ Batch conversion support for handling multiple files at once

- ‚ö° Lightweight and fast
